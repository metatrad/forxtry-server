          <p>The problem is that all the opportunities are usually provided in private for close circle of people. And participating in trading on the exchange, according to the majority, is something complicated. Brokers, exchanges - all this is incomprehensible to an ordinary person. Therefore, we are making a public platform for everyone.</p></div>
